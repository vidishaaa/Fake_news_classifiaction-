# Fake_news_classification-
The proliferation of fake news has become a major concern in the digital age. This project aims to address this issue by using machine learning models to classify news titles as either fake or real based on textual data. The project involves the application of various NLP techniques to preprocess the data and several machine learning algorithms to predict the authenticity of news titles.

##DATASET
The dataset used in this project contains news titles labeled as Fake or Real. The data was preprocessed to remove noise, tokenized, and lemmatized to convert the text into a format suitable for analysis.
The dataset was taken from Kaggle.
