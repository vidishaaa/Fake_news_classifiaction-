The proliferation of fake news has become a major concern in the digital age. This project aims to address this issue by using machine learning models to classify news titles as either fake or real based on textual data. The project involves the application of various NLP techniques to preprocess the data and several machine learning algorithms to predict the authenticity of news titles.
